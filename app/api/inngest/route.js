/*
  ðŸ”¹ This API route is used to:
     - Allow Inngest to trigger the `generateIndustryInsights` function.
     - Handle background job execution in a serverless Next.js environment.
     - Listen for HTTP GET, POST, and PUT requests to interact with Inngest.
     
  ðŸš€ This setup ensures that industry insights are generated and updated automatically!
